To start with Appium with Java We have to complete the below requirements
1) Install JDK and Java and set the JAVA_HOME in Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> System Variables
2) Download Android Studio to get the Android SDK Package to work with android apps from "https://developer.android.com/studio"
3) Check if your Android Studio contains the Android Emulator
4) Emulator is virtual android device which we are using for mobile automation
5) Download Node -> Node is required for Launching appium server because it is developed in the node platform
6) Download node js from "https://nodejs.org/en/download"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set up the Android studio and node js into your system (Windows)
1) Find the folder "AppData" inside your C Drive, As this folder is always invisible search with below path
2) ThisPC > OS(C:) > Users > {Particular_User_Name} > AppData
3) Open Folder "AppData" then open folder called "Local" present inside "AppData"
4) Open "Android" Folder present inside the "Local" Folder under "AppData"
5) Open "Sdk" Folder present inside "Android" Folder and Copy the folder path and add it in System Environment Variables
6) Set ANDROID_HOME -> C:\Users\{Particular_User_Name}\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk in Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> System Variables
7) Open Android Studio by Launching the Application and select any basic activity & Select any project from template
